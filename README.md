# Angular Spring Boot Paginator Component

During my summer internship, I encountered a challenge related to implementing Spring Boot pagination within an Angular application. To streamline the process and adhere to Angular's best practices for efficient code, I developed a customizable component named 'my-paginator'. This component is designed with @Input and @Output variables, allowing it to be easily integrated into any component within the project.

## Features
- Effortless Pagination: Seamlessly incorporate Spring Boot pagination into your Angular app without complex code.
- Reusable Component: The 'my-paginator' component is crafted for reusability, enhancing the modularity of your project.
- Customizable: Tailor the pagination component to fit your specific design and functionality requirements.
- Simple Integration: Utilize @Input variables to control the pagination logic and @Output events to capture user interactions.
- Enhanced User Experience: Improve user experience through organized and easily navigable data sets.

## Installation
To integrate the 'my-paginator' component into your Angular project, follow these steps:

1.First, clone the backend Spring Boot project from my previous repository and run it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedg99/OpenAICodex.git
cd OpenAICodex
```

Clone this repository and navigate to your project's root directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmedg99/paginator-app.git
cd paginator-app
```
npm install 
```bash
npm install
```

npm start 
```bash
npm start
```
